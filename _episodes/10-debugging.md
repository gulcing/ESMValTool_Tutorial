Every user encounters errors. Once you know why you get certain types of errors,
they become much easier to fix. The good news is, ESMValTool creates a record of
the output messages and stores them in log files. They can be used for debugging
or monitoring the process. This lesson helps to understand what the different
types of errors are and when you are likely to encounter them.

## Log files

Each time we run ESMValTool, it will produce a new output directory. This
directory should contain the ``run`` folder that is automatically generated by
ESMValTool. To examine this, we run a ``recipe_python.yml`` that can be found in
lesson [Running your first recipe]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/04-recipe.md
%}). Check lesson [Configuration]({{ page.root }}{% link
_episodes/03-configuration.md %}) on how to set paths.

In a new terminal, run the recipe:

~~~bash
  cd esmvaltool_tutorial
  esmvaltool run examples/recipe_python.yml
~~~

~~~
esmvaltool: command not found
~~~
{: .error}

ESMValTool encounters this error because the conda environment ``esmvaltool``
has not been activated. To fix the error, before running the recipe, activate
the environment:

~~~bash
conda activate esmvaltool
~~~

> ## conda environment
>
> More information about the conda environment can be found at
> [Installation]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/02-installation.md %}).
{: .callout}

Let's list the files in the ``run`` directory:

~~~bash
  ls esmvaltool_output/recipe_python_#_#/run
~~~

~~~
main_log_debug.txt  main_log.txt  map  recipe_python.yml  resource_usage.txt
timeseries
~~~
{: .output}

In the ``main_log_debug.txt`` and ``main_log.txt``, ESMValTool writes the output
messages, warnings and possible errors that might happen during pre-processings.
To inspect them, we can look inside the files. For example:

~~~bash
  cat esmvaltool_output/recipe_python_#_#/run/main_log.txt
~~~

Now, let's have a look inside the folder ``timeseries/script1``:

~~~bash
  ls esmvaltool_output/recipe_python_#_#/run/timeseries/script1/
~~~

~~~
diagnostic_provenance.yml log.txt  resource_usage.txt  settings.yml
~~~
{: .output}

In the ``log.txt``, ESMValTool writes the output messages,
warnings and possible errors that are related to the diagnostic script.

If you encounter an error and don’t know what it means, it is important to read
the log information. Sometimes knowing where the error occurred is enough to fix
it, even if you don’t entirely understand the message. However, note that you
may not always be able to find the error or fix it. In that case, ESMValTool
community helps you figure out what went wrong.

> ## Different log files
>
> In the ``run`` directory, there are two log files ``main_log_debug.txt`` and
``main_log.txt``. What are their differences?
>
>> ## Solution
>>
> > The ``main_log_debug.txt`` contains the output messages from the
> > pre-processor whereas the ``main_log.txt`` shows general errors and warnings
> > that might happen in running the recipe and diagnostics script.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Let's change some settings in the recipe to run a regional pre-processor.
We use a text editor called ``nano`` to open the recipe file:

~~~bash
  nano recipe_python.yml
~~~

> ## Text editor side note
>
> No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches
for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably)
use your current working directory as its default location. We use ``nano``
in examples here because it is one of the least complex text editors.
Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> to save the file,
and then <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> to exit ``nano``.

## Keys and values in recipe settings

The [ESMValTool
pre-processors](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/ESMValCore/en/latest/
recipe/preprocessor.html?highlight=preprocessor)
cover a broad range of operations on the input data, like time manipulation,
area manipulation, land-sea masking, variable derivation, etc. Let's add the
preprocessor ``extract_region`` to a new section ``annual_mean_regional``:

```yaml
preprocessors:
  annual_mean_regional:
    annual_statistics:
      operator: mean
    extract_region:
      start_longitude: -10
      end_longitude: 40
      start_latitude: 27
      end_latitude: 70
```

Also, we change the ``projects`` value ``esmval`` to ``tutorial``:

```yaml
projects:
  - tutorial
  - c3s-magic
```

Then, we save the file and run the recipe:
~~~bash
  esmvaltool run recipe_python.yml
~~~

~~~
ValueError: Tag 'tutorial' does not exist in section 'projects' of
esmvaltool/config-references.yml 2020-06-29 18:09:56,641 UTC [46055] INFO If you
have a question or need help, please start a new discussion on
https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/discussions If you suspect this is a
bug, please open an issue on https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues To
make it easier to find out what the problem is, please consider attaching the
files run/recipe_*.yml and run/main_log_debug.txt from the output directory.
~~~
{: .error}

The values for the keys ``author``, ``maintainer``, ``projects`` and
``references`` in the recipe should be known by ESMValTool:

- A list of ESMValTool
author, maintainer, and projects can be found in the
[config-references.yml](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/blob/master/
esmvaltool/config-references.yml).
- ESMValTool references in `BibTeX` format can be found in the
[ESMValTool/esmvaltool/references](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/
tree/master/esmvaltool/references) directory.

What suggestions would you give the researcher for fixing the error?

>> ## Solution
>>
>> 1. Check ``user-config.yml`` to see if the correct directory for input data is introduced
>> 2. Check the available data, regarding exp, mip, ensemble, start_year, and end_year
>> 3. Check the variable names in the diagnostics section in the recipe

{: .challenge}

## Check pre-processed data

The setting ``save_intermediary_cubes`` in the configuration file can be used to
save the pre-processed data. More information about this setting can be found at
[Configuration]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/03-configuration.md %}).

> ## save_intermediary_cubes
>
> Note that this setting should be only used for debugging, as it significantly
> slows down the recipe and increases disk usage because a lot of output files
> need to be stored.
{: .callout}

## Check diagnostic script path

The result of the pre-processor is passed to the ``examples/diagnostic.py``
script, that is introduced in the recipe as:

```yaml
scripts:
  script1:
    script:
      script: examples/diagnostic.py
```

The diagnostic scripts are located in the folder ``diag_scripts`` in the
ESMValTool installation directory ``<path_to_esmvaltool>``. To find
where ESMValTool is located on your system, see [Installation]({{ page.root }}{% link
_episodes/02-installation.md %}).

Let's see what happens if we can change the script path as:

```yaml
scripts:
  script1:
    script:
      script: diag_scripts/ocean/diagnostic_timeseries.py
```

~~~bash
  esmvaltool run examples/recipe_python.yml
~~~

~~~
esmvalcore._task.DiagnosticError: Cannot execute script
'diag_scripts/ocean/diagnostic_timeseries.py'
(~/mambaforge/envs/esmvaltool2.6/lib/python3.10/site-packages/esmvaltool/

bug, please open an issue on https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues To
make it easier to find out what the problem is, please consider attaching the
files run/recipe_*.yml and run/main_log_debug.txt from the output directory.
~~~
{: .error}

The script path should be relative to ``diag_scripts`` directory. It means that
the script ``diagnostic_timeseries.py`` is located in
``<path_to_esmvaltool>/diag_scripts/ocean/``.
Alternatively, the script path can be an absolute path. To examine this, we can
 download the script from the ``ESMValTool`` repository:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/main/esmvaltool/\
diag_scripts/ocean/diagnostic_timeseries.py
```

One way to get the absolute path is to run:

```bash
readlink -f diagnostic_timeseries.py
```

Then we can update the script path :

```yaml
scripts:
  script1:
    script:
      script: <path_to_script>/diagnostic_timeseries.py
```

Then, run the recipe again and examine the output to see ``Run was successful``!
